Project Name: AntiSocial

Project Description:
It's the new way to social - online! Antisocial uses mongodb and express to add users and different routes that will allow the user to be added to the database and make their first thought post. If you are a user on the site you can add reactions to other user's posts. As a user you can retrieve, delete and update posts and reactions to posts. Be interactive and share your thoughts!

Installation:
From the command line run 'npm install' and 'npm start'

Use mongodb to see the data populate there and use insomnia to test your routes based on the endpoints given in the server js file.
